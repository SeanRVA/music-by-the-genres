					<p><h1><b>What is Pop Music?</b></h1>
						Pop music is a genre of music that developed around the same time as rock, in the <b>United States and United Kingdom in the 1950s</b>. As a genre of music, it is usually topping to charts and is generally speaking, the most popular genre of music, hence its name.
					</p>
					<p>Pop music is known for its <b>simple structure and repeated choruses and hooks</b>. This is all in an attempt to make it catchy and appealing to the public. Pop music is meant to be something enjoyed or danced to, so tempos and overall dynamics of these songs tend to be very simple.

					<p>Pop music instrumentation is a mixed bag. Vocals are obviously very important as they serve as the main vehicle for expression and delivering a performance. Instruments or sounds used include <b>synths, keyboards, electric and acoustic guitars, bass guitars, drums, cymbals</b>, and more.
