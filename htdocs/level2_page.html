					<p><h1><b>What is Rock Music?</b></h1>
						Rock is a form of popular music that <b>descends from rock and roll</b>. This genre of music has become very diverse and has a variety of sub-genres like alternative rock, punk rock, psychedelic rock, and others. It was developed mostly in the 1940s and 1950s, and became more varied in the 1960s. As a genre of music, it takes a lot of inspiration from musical genres like rock and roll, which came before it, as well as blues, country, and even jazz, to name a few.
					</p>
					<p>Back then, rock served as a driving force for multiple social and cultural movements. In fact, its predecessor, rock and roll, built upon musical experimentation and lyrics about drug usage and antiestablishmentarianism. Nowadays, rock lyrics are more romance or love-related, but other topics for songs still exist. Rock is still a very prevalent genre of music in the commercial industry, and it is quite popular. 
					</p>
					<p>The main instrument of rock music is the <b>amplified electric guitar</b>. It is usually backed up by a drum kit consisting of both drums and cymbals, and an electric bass guitar. Oftentimes, other instruments like keytars, keyboards, or synthesizers also accompany them. Vocals are also a very important part of rock music, as they convey the lyrics and are the main vehicle for expression during a performance. It is possible for there to be more than one singer, in which case one is the lead and the others are backup. Rock bands usually consist of a singer, guitarist, drummer, and a pianist. However, early rock saw the use of a bassist instead of a pianist.
