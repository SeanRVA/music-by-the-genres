					<p><h1><b>What is Country Music?</b></h1>
						Country music, or western music, is a genre of music originating from the <b>Southern and Southwestern regions of the United States</b>. This genre takes inspiration from a lot of other genres of music, like <b>cowboy Western styles, American folk music, blues</b>, and others. It gained traction and became more popular in the 1920s. Since then, country has expanded and is now an umbrella term for a variety of sub-genres.
					</p>
					<p>
						Country music often has <b>simple forms, folk lyrics, and extensively used blues modes</b>. The music is often used for <b>dance or as a ballad</b>. 
					</p>
					<p>Country music instrumentation often includes instruments like <b>banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, acoustic and steel guitars</b>, and others. Newer, modernized forms of country may also use drums and different modern instruments, but these are a center of controversy since some country music-lovers think they aren't "pure". Vocals, like in pop and rock, are very important as they drive the message of the lyrics home.
