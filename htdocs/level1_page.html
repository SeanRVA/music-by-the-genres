					<p><h1><b>What is Classical Music?</b></h1>
						Historically speaking, Classical Music is defined as music created during the Classical Period, which lasted from <b>1750 to 1820</b>. However, the term "classical music" has never really had a totally clear definition, and is often used to refer to pieces from the Baroque and Romantic Periods as well. It is also used to refer to Western music beyond folk music as well. This page will be using the term "classical music" to refer mainly to music from the Common Practice Period <b>(Baroque, Galant, Classical, and Romantic music)</b>.
					</p>
					<p>Classical music is known for its complex and sophisticated musical forms, such as sonata, symphony, and concerto. Longer pieces will be divided into smaller parts called movements. <b>Movements can be further subdivided into smaller portions: sections, then periods, then phrases</b>, in that order. 
					</p>
					<p>The instruments used in classical music are generally from around the 18th and 19th centuries. These include instruments from the brass, woodwind, percussion, and string families. Beyond just instruments, vocals are also sometimes used in works like opera.
